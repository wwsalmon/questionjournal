                In the past few years, I've found <a className="underline" href="https://postulate.us/@samsonzhang/p/2021-03-12-How-to-Have-Original-Thoughts%3A-3fXWPXwup49YMJF6ZLPHQy">asking "bad questions"</a> to be one of my most meaningful sources of learning and exploration. I've kept a Notion table full of questions, with notes added over time.
                <br/><br/>
                I've since moved off of Notion, but wanted to continue my question-asking habits and have a well-built system to support it. I think there's a lot of potential to question-centric notetaking, too, extending beyond Notion's capabilities. Thus, for my own sake and as a platform for experimentation, Question Journal was born.
                <br/><br/>
                If you value learning and curiosity, I'd encourage you to try out Question Journal too, or simply keep a list of questions in your preferred app. It'll do you wonders.
                <br/><br/>
                Question Journal is still in development. It's a simple project, but not a priority of mine to build, so it may take a while ðŸ˜… Sign up for the waitlist above to be notified when it's ready, or <a className="underline" href="https://twitter.com/wwsalmon">follow me on Twitter</a> for updates!
